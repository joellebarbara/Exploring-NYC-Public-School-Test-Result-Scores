# goal:
Use data manipulation and summary statistics to analyze test scores across New York City's public schools!
# Project Description
Every year, school test results play a role in deciding the fate of millions of students. In America, the SAT is a major part of the college admissions process.

In this project, you will work with a dataset containing test performance from NYC's public schools.

You will identify the schools with top math results, look at how performance varies by borough, and find the top ten performing schools across the city!
